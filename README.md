# Fraiwork

Frasier is built on a powerful and flexible Python framework that enables seamless integration of various AI capabilities. The framework is designed with modularity and extensibility in mind, allowing developers to easily add new features and customize existing ones.

The core of Frasier is built on an event-driven architecture that processes user inputs through a pipeline of specialized modules. Each module is responsible for a specific aspect of the agent's functionality, such as natural language understanding, task planning, or execution.


class FrasierCore:
    def __init__(self):
        self.modules = {
            'planner': TaskPlanner(),
            'memory': MemoryManager(),
            'executor': TaskExecutor(),
            'feedback': FeedbackLoop()
        }
        
    async def process_input(self, user_input: str) -> Response:
        context = await self.memory.get_context()
        plan = await self.planner.create_plan(user_input, context)
        result = await self.executor.execute(plan)
        return await self.feedback.process(result)

Frasier implements a sophisticated memory management system that maintains both short-term and long-term memory. This enables the agent to maintain context across conversations and learn from past interactions:


class MemoryManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.short_term = ShortTermMemory(capacity=1000)
        self.long_term = LongTermMemory(db_path="memory.db")
        
    async def store(self, information: dict):
        await self.short_term.add(information)
        if self.should_persist(information):
            await self.long_term.store(information)



# Using frasier

Python 3.8+
pip (Python package installer)

pip install frasier-ai

git clone https://github.com/fra-sier/frasier.git
cd frasier
pip install -e .

from frasier import FrasierAgent

# Initialize Frasier
agent = FrasierAgent()

# Usage
# Start interaction
response = agent.process("Hello, I need help with data analysis.")
print(response)

# Config
# config.yaml
frasier:
  language: "en"
  plugins_enabled: true
  memory_size: 1000
  response_mode: "detailed"

# Plugin
from frasier.plugins import FrasierPlugin

class CustomAnalyzer(FrasierPlugin):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("custom_analyzer")
    
    def process(self, input_data):
        # Implementation
        return processed_result
